perspectives:
- meaning: "avoiding duplication in one's code and not hardcoding the same values, functions or patterns over and over. For instance, if a dev hardcoded a color value repeatedly in their stylesheet, they could instead create a variable once(--favpink: #FF69B4;) and use the variable name repeatedly instead of the hex code to make the stylesheet more DRY"
