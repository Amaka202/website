title: Refactoring
definition: 'Refactoring is a methodical process for reorganizing a body of existing code and modifying its internal organization without changing its external behaviour. It is a more specific technique of restructuring. It is based on the use of small behaviour-preserving transformations (called refactorings). Refactoring should not break your code.'
